 Step 1: Detect Execution of Suspicious Scripts from /tmp Folder
Purpose:
Scripts or binaries run from /tmp are often a red flag in real-world attacks. This step simulates and detects execution of such potentially malicious behavior.

What I Did:
Created a malicious-looking script in /tmp/malicious.txt:
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a malicious activity" > /dev/null
sleep 180

Saved and gave it execute permissions:
chmod +x /tmp/malicious.txt

Executed the script in one terminal:
/tmp/malicious.txt

Then opened osqueryi in a second terminal:
sudo osqueryi

Ran this query to detect processes running from /tmp:
sql
SELECT pid, name, cmdline, uid FROM processes WHERE cmdline LIKE '%/tmp/%';

Output:
This query lists all processes whose command line contains /tmp, showing the:
PID
Process name
Command line
User ID

If a malicious script is running, it will appear in this table.

Why This Matters:
Attackers often drop binaries or scripts in /tmp because it's writable by all users. This detection helps in early identification of abnormal behavior and investigation.
