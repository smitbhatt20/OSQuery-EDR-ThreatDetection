# OSQuery-EDR-ThreatDetection
This project demonstrates how to use OSQuery for real-time threat detection and system monitoring on a Linux environment. It simulates common attacker behaviors like running scripts from /tmp, privilege escalation, and unauthorized file changes—then uses custom SQL queries in OSQuery to detect those actions.
